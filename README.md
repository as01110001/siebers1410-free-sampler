# siebers1410-free-sampler
Here you can download two presets that we created to play the "Siebers 1410" library with Kontakt and Sforzando. These presets are under development and you can download it for free to quick start using our library. We also like the idea of having it open source, feel free to modify the code or create a new virtual instrument and share it with us here.

You can buy Siebers 1410 full samples pack at our website:
