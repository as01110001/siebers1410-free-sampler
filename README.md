Kontakt:

- A/B Mix (Knob): Control the mix between the two microphones positions.
              A: Neumann km416 in AB40 from the top of the piano. More natural sound, more room presence.
              B: Sony PCM D-100 in XY position from the bottom of the piano, near the string. Deep sound, less room presence.
